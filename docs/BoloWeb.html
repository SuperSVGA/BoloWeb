<h1 align=center>BoloWeb</h1>

<p>BoloWeb is a service which tells you about
<a href="http://ResComp.Stanford.EDU/~cheshire/Bolo.html">Bolo</a> games
that are taking place right now on the internet. BoloWeb contacts Bolo
Trackers to obtain a list of ongoing games and displays the list in your
web browser. Currently BoloWeb gets the game information from Black
Lightning's Internet Bolo Tracker (bolo.usu.edu) which also
includes the listing from Mike Ellis's Bolo Tracker (gwis.circ.gwu.edu).
If there is interest, future versions of BoloWeb may be extended to talk
to other trackers and provide a uniform window to the Bolo World.</p>

<p>BoloWeb will display a list of Bolo games on any Web Browser, but
if you want to automatically join an Internet Game of Bolo with a
single mouse click, you need the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>An Apple Macintosh Computer that is connected to the Internet
(i.e. <b>not</b> behind a firewall that prevents Bolo packets from
getting through).
<li>The current version of
<a href="ftp://bolo.stanford.edu/Public/Bolo0.99.7.cpt.hqx">Bolo</a>
already installed on your Mac's hard disk.
<li>A suitable Web browser that can support Bolo URLs (for more information,
see below).
</ol>

<Form method=GET action="http://BoloWeb.Stanford.EDU/BoloWeb.ACGI">
<CENTER>
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="View the current BoloWeb list of games">
</CENTER>
</Form>

<p>BoloWeb is Freeware. You can get copy of all source files from
<a href="https://github.com/SuperSVGA/BoloWeb">BoloWeb v0.8 Sources</a>
<hr>

<h1>How the clickable links work</h1>

<p>The game links in the BoloWeb listing use a special kind of URL.
Conventional URLs usually start with "http://..." or "ftp://..." to
indicate which network protocol should be used. Bolo game URLs start
with "bolo://..." to indicate that the Bolo protocol should be used.
Since web browsers don't know the Bolo protocol, they launch an external
application -- Bolo -- to make the connection for them. (Note that this
is <b>not</b> the same as a MIME type. MIME types are used when the browser
understands the protocol used to fetch the document, but then doesn't
know what to do with the document when it has it. An ongoing Bolo game
is obviously not a "document" that you can download with ftp and save
on your hard disk.)</p>

<p>The only problem is that most Web browsers don't know about
"bolo" URLs. If all Web Browsers used
<a href="http://www.share.com/share/peterlewis/ic/internetconfig.html">Internet Config</a>
(a creation of Quinn and Peter Lewis) then it wouldn't be a problem
because you could just add Bolo to your Internet Config Helper list and
it would work automatically without you having to wait for application
writers to update their programs.</p>

<a name = "Netscape"><h3>Netscape</h3></a>

<p>Netscape versions 1.1 and later have support for Bolo URLs built-in.
No special set-up or configuration is necessary.</p>

<h3>MacWeb</h3>

<p>You can make MacWeb (version 1.00ALPHA3 or later) BoloURL-aware by
adding a new Protocol Helper with ResEdit. Follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open MacWeb with ResEdit.
<li>Open 'MIME' Resource id 512 (Called "Default Protocol Helper Info").
<li>Click on the line that says "1) *****" and type Cmd-K to create a new record.
<li>Fill in the new record as follows:
<pre>
mime_type:        bolo   (it's not really a mime type, but never mind.)
application name: Bolo
Type:             BOLO
Creator:          BOLO
Signature:        BOLO
Flags:            16
</pre>
<li>Quit ResEdit and save changes.
</ol>

<h3>NCSA Mosaic</h3>

<p>NCSA have promised that future versions of Mosaic will support Bolo
URLs, though they have not said whether it will be a special-case hack
for Bolo (like Netscape did in version 1.1), or whether they will adopt
Internet Config so that they automatically support all present and
future compatible applications (which is the right way to do it).</p>

<h3>Nuntius</h3>

<p>Nuntius 2.0.1 or later recognises Bolo URLs, but you have to add some
lines to its "URL script" so that it knows what to do with them. The lines
should be added between the initial "try" line and the
"if (theScheme is "ftp"...)" line, like this:</p>
<pre>
try
	if (theScheme is "bolo") then
		tell application "Bolo 0.99.7"
			activate
			&lt&ltevent GURLGURL&gt&gt theURL
		end tell
    else
        if (theScheme is "ftp" and ((offset of ".htm" in theURL) is 0))
</pre>

<p>and a final matching "end if" should be added just before the final
"on error e number en" line.</p>

<p>Note: The &lt&lt and &gt&gt symbols are actually the Macintosh chevron
characters, Option-\ and Shift-Option-\</p>

<hr>

<h1>Access speed</h1>

<p>If accessing the game list seems slow, it is because HTTP opens a
separate TCP connection for every little icon, even thought they are
only about 200 bytes each and all of them together could fit in a
single Ethernet packet if Web browsers just used UDP instead of TCP.
Lets hope for more sophisticated protocols in the future.</p>
